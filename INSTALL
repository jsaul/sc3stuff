It is a good idea to install sc3stuff along with your SeisComP
Python codes. The simplest way to do that is by copying the sc3stuff
subfolder to the same folder as the SeisComP Python codes. If your
Python installation is under $HOME/seiscomp, this would mean

cp -pr sc3stuff $HOME/seiscomp/lib/python
